        Homework 13 01
        John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants.
        The bills were $124, $48 and $268.

        To tip the waiter a fair amount, 
        John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).
        He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 
        15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, 
        and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

        In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
        1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
        2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip). // kolku ke potrosi pari so baksis

        (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
        */

        function tipCalculator(bill) {
            var percentage;

            if (bill < 50) {
                percentage = 0.2;
            } else if (bill >= 50 && bill < 200) {
                percentage = 0.15;
            } else {
                percentage = 0.1;
            }
            return bill * percentage
        };

        var bills = [
            124,
            48,
            268
        ];
        var tips = [
            tipCalculator(bills[0]),
            tipCalculator(bills[1]),
            tipCalculator(bills[2])
        ];

        var finalAmounts = [
            bills[0] + tips[0],
            bills[1] + tips[1],
            bills[2] + tips[2]
        ];

        console.log (tips, finalAmounts)
